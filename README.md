#Moka

*Moka* is an application to crowdfund [Cosmic Trigger Play](http://cosmictriggerplay.com).
Unlike other crowdfunding applications it is not meant to collect money, but asks contributors
for specific items or services they can pledge to give.
 
The name [Moka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_exchange) refers to a specific type of gift
economy on Papua New Guinea. This software is neither an attempt to implement the particular
concept of *Moka* nor is it modelled on the aforementioned gift exchange system.
